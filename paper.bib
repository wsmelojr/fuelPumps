abstract = {Blockchain, as one of the core technologies in Bitcoin that is the most representative cryptocurrency, has received extensive attentions recently. Blockchain can be used as a peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized system to store the pseudonymous transaction records in a trustless environment. It is believed that blockchain can be used in a diversity of future Internet interaction systems, such as smart contracts, public services, Internet of Things (IoT), reputation systems and security services rather than financial systems only. However, a number of technical challenges prohibit the wide application of blockchain. Therefore, we present a comprehensive survey on blockchain technologies. In particular, we first provide an overview of blockchain technologies and a taxonomy of various blockchain systems. We then enumerate a number of both current and future blockchain applications. We also discuss the challenges in this promising area and discuss the future directions.},

abstract = {In Europe, measuring instruments subject to legal control are responsible for an annual turnover of 500 billion Euros and need to pass a conformity assessment with respect to European directives or national legislation before they can be used. Today, measuring instruments are frequently integrated into open networks and even branch into the areas of cloud computing and Internet of Things. Since software is one of the key components of such devices, Germany's national metrology institute, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesantalt, is developing a method to assess the risks and evaluate current threats associated with software. The method uses the structure of and combines elements from the international ISO/IEC standards 27005 and 15408. It could be helpful for conformity assessment bodies and industry alike and supports the comparability of risk assessment results. Despite its focus on legal metrology, the method is applicable to other areas where software risk assessment is required, too. I.},

abstract = {One of the problems associated with automotive fuel tanks is premature shut-off during the filling process. This occurs when the fuel dispensing nozzle shuts off before the fuel tank is completely filled. A comprehensive but simplified lumped parameter model has been developed to determine the pressure and flow rate associated with the automotive fuel tank for the purpose of predicting premature shut-off. Unlike previous work, this model includes the entire fuel system, including a closed rectangular tank with a filler tube, rollover valve, and vent tube that connects the filler tube to the tank. The system was divided into several control volumes and connecting valves. Continuity equations were written for each of the control volumes and energy equations were written for each of the connecting valves. The model includes the effects of the fuel tank system geometry, fuel nozzle dispensing rate, fuel volatility, multiphase, multicomponent flow through the filler tube, air/fuel vapour in the tank dome, vapour generation and choking in the vent tube, and the rollover valve due to the low speed of sound of the vapour droplet flow. This mathematical model consists of five nonlinear, integral equations and a number of algebraic equations. A commercial numerical solver (Simulink) was used to solve these equations subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The simplified model was used to generate results to compare with existing experimental results. In spite of its simplicity, it was capable of predicting the nature of the shut-off for all of the corresponding sets of experimental data. Prediction of the magnitudes of the tank dome pressure and the filler tube pressure were, however, only in fair agreement with the experimental values. The model was also used to perform a sensitivity analysis of model parameters. The results were found to be most sensitive to vent area around the filler nozzle, liquid dispensing flowrate, and fuel volatility.},

Two different protocols are suggested. Each one is evaluated using probabilistic analysis and simulation. In the end, we implement the authentication mechanism in a case study using networks radio signal as physical event generator.Te results demonstrate the performance of each of the protocols and their suitability for applications in real world.},

A key property of HLF is its extensibility, and in particular the support for multiple ordering services for building the blockchain. Nonetheless, the version 1.0 was launched in early 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for HLF on top of the BFT-SMaRt state machine replication/consensus library, implementing also optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that HLF with our ordering service can achieve up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread in different continents.},

An evaluation of the proposed method is done by comparing the estimated instantaneous fuel consumption with that measured by the car's onboard diagnostics data bus. The results of three tests with different cars driven in mixed highway and urban conditions indicate that the instantaneous fuel consumption may be estimated with a root mean square error of {\~{}}0.3 [g/s], in terms of a normalized mean square error, that corresponded to slightly {\textless};10{\%}.

The Joint Committee took on this part of the work of the ISO Technical Advisory Group 4 (TAG 4), which had developed the GUM and the VIM. The Joint Committee was originally made up of representatives from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML). In 2005, the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) officially joined the seven founding international organizations. The JCGM has two Working Groups. Working Group 1 (JCGM/WG 1) on the GUM has the task of promoting the use of the GUM and preparing Supplements to the GUM for broad application. Working Group 2 (JCGM/WG 2) on the VIM has the task of revising the VIM and promoting its use. Working Group 2 is composed of up to two representatives of each member organization, supplemented by a limited number of experts. The third edition of the VIM has been prepared by Working Group 2. In 2004, a first draft of the third edition of the VIM was submitted for comments and proposals to the eight organizations represented in the JCGM, which in most cases consulted their members or affiliates, including numerous National Metrology Institutes. Comments were studied and discussed, taken into account when appropriate, and replied to by JCGM/WG 2. A final draft of the third edition was submitted in 2006 to the eight organizations for review and approval. All subsequent comments were considered and taken into account as appropriate by Working Group 2. The third edition of the VIM has been approved by each and all of the eight JCGM Member organizations. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition 1993.},

Measurement data, gathered from On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), are logged on the onboard device for remote backup. An accurate analysis of the collected data has been performed to identify the main parameters able to monitor driver behavior and to define suitable indexes to evaluate the driving performance. Particular attention has been paid to the analysis of vehicle parameters during braking and gear shifting in order to classify different attitudes and generate driver profiles and trends. Understanding drivers' characteristic behavior can contribute significantly to road safety, to define insurance premium, to engage user in saving fuel and money and to correlate faults of the car with the driving style.},

abstract = {Bitcoin cryptocurrency demonstrated the utility of global consensus across thousands of nodes, changing the world of digital transactions forever. In the early days of Bitcoin, the performance of its probabilistic proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus fabric, also known as blockchain, was not a major issue. Bitcoin became a success story, despite its consensus latencies on the order of an hour and the theoretical peak throughput of only up to 7 transactions per second.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe situation today is radically different and the poor performance scalability of early PoW blockchains no longer makes sense. Specifically, the trend of modern cryptocurrency platforms, such as Ethereum, is to support execution of arbitrary distributed applications on blockchain fabric, needing much better performance. This approach, however, makes cryptocurrency platforms step away from their original purpose and enter the domain of database-replication protocols, notably, the classical state-machine replication, and in particular its Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) variants.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn this paper, we contrast PoW-based blockchains to those based on BFT state machine replication, focusing on their scalability limits. We also discuss recent proposals to overcoming these scalability limits and outline key outstanding open problems in the quest for the “ultimate” blockchain fabric(s).},

abstract = {This work presents the countermeasures taken by Inmetro in order to address the high technology frauds identified in fuel dispensers (FD). The final effect of such frauds consists in indicating a measurement result which is higher than the actual fuel quantity that the final consumer receives in the vehicle tank. Inmetro's actions to confront this problem are divided into three main work fronts: (i) fraud technical characterization and instrument vulnerabilities identification, (ii) development of technological tools to aid in inspections and issuing of expertise certificates, and (iii) discuss and establish new software and hardware security requirements for future FDs. The results obtained with these actions were the complete technical characterization and classification of the diverse fraud evidences that Inmetro has received since 2012. Additionally, a total of 81 metrologists from all over the country were trained to identify the different fraud implementations known so far. Finally, new security requirements are currently being discussed with FD manufacturers and other stakeholders so that, in the near future, a more reliable measurement is achieved by the instrument.},

A systematic, logical and consistent process has been used to organize and extract the contributions of published academic studies in the field. A systematic literature review process has also been shown to be an appropriate tool to manage and organize the growing number of databases for articles and journals, allowing the identification of relevant contributions. A total of 59 studies were selected and categorized based on four different approaches: the economy and society, international trade, legal metrological control, and metrology in developing countries. The 59 selected articles are discussed in order to explore the state of the art concerning legal metrology, with a focus on legal metrological control. On the basis of these categories, open issues were also identified in order to suggest future studies in the field.},

With the purpose of proposing the adoption of a technology that could fill the present gaps, the work was developed from (i) the study of the current model of fuel sale to final costumers; (ii) the frauds identified; (iii) the inherent care that the production of electrical equipments for flammable environments requires and; (iv) the needs of government employees in charge of the supervision of retail stations. The technological solution proposed in this article combines the principles of low cost, easy implementation, non-substitution of the fuel pumps already in the market, information tracking of fuel trading from the source closest to where the trade actually takes place, transparency and safety in the information transmission to supervisors, done in such a way as to minimize the impacts on the commercial activities of the stations. The term “technology” is used to define equipments, communication media and software engineering that allow an extended computational support to the field, in order to improve and accelerate specific activities.},

abstract = {Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts—scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.},

abstract = {In today's world, the actual record of fuel filled and fuel consumption in vehicles is not maintained. It results in a financial loss. To quantify the actual amount of fuel into the tank we implement the system using the Internet of things. The system uses the flow sensor which calculates the amount of fuel runtime while filling the tank. The ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors the level of fuel in the tank. If suddenly the level fuel goes low then the system rings the beep and notifies the owner of car or bike. The system also provides the reporting function in which the fraud is directly reported to the higher authority or government officials. The system also stores the historical data for future use.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems. We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to re-lying smart contracts. TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a gen-eralization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently in-troduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results in-clude definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's " gas " fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications. We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service.},

abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},
